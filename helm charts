helm  is package manager for k8s like yum,apt.
it also helps us to deploy app in easier way like we have template of apps that are customisable like let's say like we want to install Jenkins you can just fetch the template and you can customise it and you can deploy it

snap install helm --classic
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm search repo
helm pull bitnami/nginx --untar
ll
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
(my-nginx or you can give any name_

some charts you dont get  loadbalancer service by default like grafana installation
helm pull bitnami/grafana --untar
vi values.yml
service:
  type: LoadBalancer

paste these in values.yml and run
helm install my-grafana bitnami/grafana -f values.yml
you will get loadbalancer type service

some charts if you install they will be in tar format you can untar it like jenkins
helm pull bitnami/jenkins
tar -zxvf jenkins-12.10.1.tgz
helm install jen bitnami/jenkins
